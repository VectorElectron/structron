# structron 

Recently, I am trying to write some computational geometry-related functionalities. Since data structures like heaps, stacks, queues, trees, etc., are frequently used in computational geometry, these structures cannot be directly expressed as vector operations in NumPy. Also, Numba currently does not provide many advanced data structures. Therefore, I would like to develop a set of containers based on Numba to support computational geometry algorithms. structron comes from "Numba's STL container."

## Container Objects
Regarding containers:
Numba provides TypedList, which is primarily designed for general-purpose workflows and offers methods such as insert, pop, append, and more. However, when it comes to solving specific problems, there may not be efficient specialized data structures available (this is a conjecture and has not been tested). Therefore, it is suggested to implement various specialized containers for addressing specific problem domains.

## Features

1. **Seamless Integration with NumPy**:  
   All containers are implemented based on `ndarray`, ensuring seamless integration with various data processing scenarios. This makes them ideal for numerical computing and data analysis tasks.

2. **Efficient Linear Table Implementation**:  
   Linear tables (e.g., `TypedMemory`) use an array-based `next` column to replace traditional pointers. This ensures data is always stored in order, and released slots are efficiently reused in a circular manner.

3. **Pure Array-Based Red-Black Tree**:  
   The Red-Black Tree is implemented purely using arrays, with `left` and `right` columns recording the indices of corresponding nodes in the array. This design eliminates the need for dynamic memory allocation and pointer management, improving performance and memory efficiency.

4. **Outstanding Performance**:  
   Extensive testing shows that the performance of `Hash` and `RedBlackTree` is comparable to C++'s STL. This makes the containers suitable for high-performance computing and real-time applications.

### Why Choose These Containers?
- **Memory Efficiency**: Leveraging `ndarray` and array-based designs minimizes memory overhead.
- **High Performance**: Optimized implementations ensure competitive performance with low-level languages.
- **Flexibility**: Supports both standalone and shared memory modes, catering to diverse use cases.
- **Ease of Use**: Designed to work seamlessly with Python's scientific computing ecosystem.

## `TypedMemory` Container

`TypedMemory` is a high-performance memory management container for custom data types, built with `numba`. It dynamically manages memory allocation and deallocation, maintaining a free list for efficient reuse of released slots and automatically expanding capacity when necessary.

### Example Code

```python
import numpy as np
import numba as nb
import structron

# Custom point structure
t_point = np.dtype([('x', np.float32), ('y', np.float32)])

# Build two points
p1, p2 = np.array([(1,1), (2,2)], t_point)

# Define a TypedMemory class for the custom dtype
PointMemory = structron.TypedMemory(t_point)

# Instantiate a memory pool with a capacity of 10
points = PointMemory(10)

# Allocate memory and store a value
i = points.push(p1)  # Returns the index of the allocated slot

# Access the value at index `i`
points[i]  # Returns (x=1.0, y=1.0)

# Deallocate the memory at index `i`
points.pop(i)  # Frees the slot for reuse

# Get container size
points.size  # Current number of allocated elements
len(points)  # Total capacity of the memory pool
```

### Methods

- `TypedMemory(dtype)`: Defines a memory pool class for the specified `dtype`.
- `push(value)`: Allocates a slot and stores `value`. Returns the index.

# Define a TypedDeque class for the custom dtype
PointDeque = structron.TypedDeque(t_point)

# Instantiate a deque with a capacity of 10
points = PointDeque(10)

# Push elements
points.push_front(p1)  # Push to the front
points.push_back(p2)   # Push to the back

# Access elements
points.first()  # Get the first element

## `TypedHash` Container

`TypedHash` is a hash-based container for custom data types, optimized with `numba`. It provides efficient insertion, deletion, and lookup operations.

### Example Code

IntTree = structron.TypedRBTree(np.int32)

# Instantiate a tree with a capacity of 10
treeset = IntTree(10)

# Insert an element
treeset.push(1)  # Add to the tree

treeset.has(1)  # Returns True if the element is present

# Remove an element
treeset.pop(1)  # Removes the element from the tree

# Access neighbors
treeset.left(1)  # Returns the left neighbor of the key
treeset.right(1) # Returns the right neighbor of the key

# Get container size

## `TypedAVLTree` Container

`TypedAVLTree` is an AVL Tree implementation for custom data types, optimized with `numba`. Its interface is identical to `TypedRedBlackTree`.

### Example Code

```python
import numpy as np
import numba as nb
import structron

# Define a TypedAVLTree class for int32
IntTree = structron.TypedAVLTree(np.int32)

# Same as TypedRBTree
```

### Methods

The interface is identical to `TypedRedBlackTree`. Refer to the `TypedRedBlackTree` documentation for details.


## Map Mode: `<Heap, Hash, RedBlackTree, AVLTree>`

The map mode allows using `Heap`, `Hash`, `RedBlackTree`, and `AVLTree` as key-value containers. The `TypedXXX` function accepts two parameters: the key type and the value type. The interface extends the non-map mode by requiring a key and value for `push`, and supports accessing values using the key as a subscript.

### Example Code (Using `RedBlackTree`)

```python
import numpy as np
import numba as nb
import structron

# Custom point structure
t_point = np.dtype([('x', np.float32), ('y', np.float32)])

# Build two points
p1, p2 = np.array([(1,1), (2,2)], t_point)

# Define a TypedRBTree class for int32 keys and point values
IntPointTree = structron.TypedRBTree(np.int32, t_point)

# Instantiate a tree with a capacity of 10
treemap = IntPointTree(10)

# Insert a key-value pair
treemap.push(1, p1)  # Push key=1, value=(1, 1)

# Access the value by key
treemap[1]  # Returns the value (x=1.0, y=1.0)

# Other methods are the same as the non-map mode
# e.g., treemap.has(1), treemap.pop(1), treemap.left(1), treemap.right(1)
```

### Supported Containers

The map mode is supported for the following containers:
- **Heap**: `TypedHeap(key_dtype, value_dtype)`
- **Hash**: `TypedHash(key_dtype, value_dtype)`
- **RedBlackTree**: `TypedRBTree(key_dtype, value_dtype)`
- **AVLTree**: `TypedAVLTree(key_dtype, value_dtype)`

### Key Differences from Non-Map Mode
1. The `TypedXXX` function accepts two parameters: `key_dtype` and `value_dtype`.
2. The `push` method requires both a key and a value: `push(key, value)`.
3. Values can be accessed using the key as a subscript: `container[key]`.
4. Other methods (e.g., `has`, `pop`, `left`, `right`) remain the same as in the non-map mode.

## Eval Mode: `<Heap, RedBlackTree, AVLTree>`

The eval mode allows using `Heap`, `RedBlackTree`, and `AVLTree` as None-value containers. The `TypedXXX` function accepts two parameters: the evalue function and the value type. The interface extends the key-map mode by passing None as key, and the eval function would evalue it as key.

### Example Code (Using `Heap`)

```python
import numpy as np
import numba as nb
import structron

# Custom point structure
t_point = np.dtype([('x', np.float32), ('y', np.float32)])

# Build two points
p1, p2 = np.array([(1,1), (2,2)], t_point)

# a simple eval function, self means the heap object
# we can subclass the TypedHeap, and add some properties, then use them in eval function
eval = lambda self, p: p.x + p.y

# Define a TypedHeap class for point values with eval function
PointHeap = structron.TypedHeap(eval, t_point)

# Instantiate a heap with capacity of 10
heap = PointHeap(10)

# Insert 2 points
heap.push(None, p1)
heap.push(None, p2)

# Get the top element
heap.top()

# Other methods are the same as the map mode
```

### Supported Containers

The map mode is supported for the following containers:
- **Heap**: `TypedHeap(key_dtype, value_dtype)`
- **RedBlackTree**: `TypedRBTree(key_dtype, value_dtype)`
- **AVLTree**: `TypedAVLTree(key_dtype, value_dtype)`

### Differences from Map Mode
If the `eval` function is static (i.e., the evaluation result does not change over time), it is recommended to precompute the keys and use **Map Mode** instead. This approach is more efficient because the keys are calculated once and reused, avoiding repeated evaluations during container operations.

In contrast, **Eval Mode** dynamically evaluates values during container adjustments. For example, in a Red-Black Tree, the tree does not reorder all values when a new value is pushed. Instead, the new value is dynamically compared with relevant elements as needed. This is particularly useful in scenarios like the event queue in computational geometry (e.g., sweep line algorithms), where values need to be dynamically evaluated and ordered based on changing conditions.

### More Container
More containers will be implemented successively. Welcome to provide suggestions or participate in project development.

## Demo
The original intention of developing structron was to create a framework that facilitates the implementation of computational geometry algorithms. Here, we will demonstrate the usage of structron using a simple yet classic example, and perform a performance test.

### Convex Hull
Algorithm Implementation:
1. Sort the points by their X-coordinate.
2. Build the upper half: Start from the leftmost point and push it onto the stack. For each new point, check the last two points on the stack. If they form a right turn with the new point, push the new point onto the stack. Otherwise, pop the top element from the stack until a right turn is obtained.
3. Build the lower half: Start from the rightmost point and push it onto the stack. For each new point, check the last two points on the stack. If they form a right turn with the new point, push the new point onto the stack. Otherwise, pop the top element from the stack until a right turn is obtained.
4. Combine the upper and lower halves to obtain the convex hull.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

import numpy as np
import numba as nb
import structron

# build Point dtype and PointStack
t_point = np.dtype([('x', np.float32), ('y', np.float32)])
PointStack = structron.TypedStack(t_point)

# push to stack one by one, if not turn right, pop
@nb.njit
def convex_line(pts, idx):
    hull = PointStack(128)
    for i in idx:
        p2 = pts[i]
        while hull.size>1:
            p1 = hull.top(0)
            p0 = hull.top(1)
            s = p0.x*p1.y - p0.y*p1.x
            s += p1.x*p2.y - p1.y*p2.x
            s += p2.x*p0.y - p2.y*p0.x
            if s<-1e-6: break
            hull.pop()
        hull.push(p2)
    return hull.body[:hull.size]

# get up line and down line, then concat the hull
@nb.njit
def convexhull(pts):
    idx = np.argsort(pts['x'])
    up = convex_line(pts, idx)
    down = convex_line(pts, idx[::-1])
    return np.concatenate((up, down[1:]))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    from time import time
    # use randn to make 102400 random points
    pts = np.random.randn(102400, 2).astype(np.float32)
    pts = pts.ravel().view(t_point)

    hull = convexhull(pts)
    start = time()
    hull = convexhull(pts)
    print('convex hull of 102400 point cost:', time()-start)
```
![1714464150709](https://github.com/Image-Py/structron/assets/24822467/576eec48-5d0d-4d17-a84d-58ca70279845)

Then, we perform performance comparison using Shapely for convex hull computation on datasets of the same.
```python
from shapely import geometry as geom

pts = np.random.randn(102400, 2).astype(np.float32)
mpoints = geom.MultiPoint(pts)
start = time()
cvxh = mpoints.convex_hull
print('the same points by shapely cost:', time()-start)
```
we got the result below:
```
convex hull of 102400 point cost: 0.01891
the same points by shapely cost: 0.04986

convex hull of 1024000 point cost: 0.23035
the same points by shapely cost: 1.08539
```
With the increase in data volume, it has become evident that the performance of shapely is slower. Please note that this comparison is solely focused on the generation of convex hulls, excluding the time spent on data construction. In fact, the I/O overhead from numpy to shapely for large data sets is also significant. Therefore, I believe it is meaningful to build efficient 2D and 3D geometry algorithms using Python and leveraging numba.
